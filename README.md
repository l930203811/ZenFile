## 🚀 What's New in v1.1.2

---

🐛 Bug Fixes

· Fixed an issue where SMB client connection would show an empty directory if the share name was left blank. Now, you can connect without entering a share name, and the app will automatically scan and list all shared directories on the remote host.

✨ New Features

· On the category page, long‑press a category icon to bring up an action menu, allowing you to quickly rename, disable, or customize the scan location for that category. You can also drag icons to freely reorder categories.

🎨 UI Improvements

· Adjusted the width of the left/right sliding drawers, reducing them by approximately 10% to give more room to the main content area.

⚠️ Known Issues (to be fixed in the next version)

· The app may crash upon reopening after clearing its data.
· Adjusting the display size of external subtitles in the video player does not take effect.
· Currently, only the WebDAV client supports media file streaming; other clients do not yet support this feature.
· After entering any shared directory via the SMB client, returning to the parent directory shows an empty list, and the breadcrumb path is incorrect.
