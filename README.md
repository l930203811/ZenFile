## 🚀 What's New in v1.1.26

### 🔧 Optimizations

- SMB download acceleration: removed double-buffer prefetch and switched to single-threaded sequential read/write, greatly improving large-file transfer speed.
- Removed the backup icon set, significantly reducing the app (APK) install size.
- Polished details: the "Network" drawer list's three-dot button is now right-aligned, and quick-action page titles wrap automatically.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed FTP download speed being wrongly capped at 30–40 MB/s (caused by an overly small write-flush interval).
- Fixed three remote-client issues (SMB/FTP/SFTP): transfer cancellation, list stuttering, and page refresh.
- Fixed anomalies caused by leftover openlist references.

### ⚠️ Known Issues

- SMB / FTP / SFTP remote video playback may still stutter in some scenarios; optimization is ongoing.
